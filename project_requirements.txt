Here is a more structured and detailed document for your Inventory Management System (IMS), complete with designs and a suggested project flow:


 Inventory Management System - Requirements and Design Document

 1. Introduction

 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements and design of an Inventory Management System (IMS) for a small retail business. This system will streamline inventory tracking, restock management, sales recording, and reporting.

 1.2 Scope
This IMS will:
- Allow users to manage product details.
- Provide real-time stock tracking and notifications for low stock levels.
- Maintain sales transaction records.
- Generate sales reports for analysis.
- Maintain supplier details for restocking purposes.

 1.3 Users
- Administrator: Manages products, stock levels, and suppliers.
- Sales Staff: Processes sales, views stock levels, and generates reports.


 2. Functional Requirements

 2.1 User Authentication
- Users must log in with role-based access:
  - Administrator: Full access to manage products, stocks, and suppliers.
  - Sales Staff: Restricted access to sales processing and reporting.

 2.2 Product Management
- Add, update, and delete product details: name, SKU, price, supplier, and stock quantity.

 2.3 Stock Management
- View real-time stock levels.
- Set stock threshold levels.
- Receive notifications for low stock levels.

 2.4 Sales Management
- Record sales transactions: product, quantity, date, and optional customer details.
- Update stock levels upon sale completion.
- Generate sales reports for the last 30 days.

 2.5 Supplier Management
- Maintain a supplier database.
- Associate products with suppliers.
- Generate supplier contact lists for restocking.


 3. Non-Functional Requirements

 3.1 Security
- Implement password-protected user authentication.
- Restrict access based on user roles.

 3.2 Performance
- Handle up to 1,000 products efficiently.
- Generate sales reports within 5 seconds.

 3.3 Usability
- Ensure a simple, user-friendly interface requiring minimal training.


 4. System Architecture

 Actors and Use Cases
| Actor         | Use Case                |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Admin     | Manage Products, Manage Stock, Generate Reports |
| Sales Staff | Process Sales, Generate Reports |

 Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular, layered design:
1. User Interface (UI): Web-based or desktop application.
2. Business Logic Layer (BLL): Handles stock updates, sales processing, and notifications.
3. Database Layer: Manages product, stock, sales, and supplier data.

 5. Project Flow

 Phase 1: Requirement Analysis
- Define user roles (Admin, Sales Staff).
- List functional and non-functional requirements.

 Phase 2: System Design
- Create database schema.
- Design UI mockups.
- Define modular components (Product Management, Stock Management, etc.).

 Phase 3: Development
- Set up the database (SQLite).
- Implement the UI using React/Tailwind CSS or another suitable frontend framework.
- Develop the backend with Spring Boot or Node.js.

 Phase 4: Testing
- Test user authentication and role-based access control.
- Validate stock tracking, sales processing, and report generation.
- Conduct performance testing for 1,000+ products.

 Phase 5: Deployment
- Deploy the system to the target environment.
- Conduct user training.


 6. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

 Level 0 - Context Diagram
The system interacts with two main actors: Admin and Sales Staff. Here's how data flows:
- Admin: Manages products, suppliers, and stock thresholds.
- Sales Staff: Processes sales and generates reports.

 Level 1 - DFD
Processes:
1. Manage Products: Add/Update/Delete product details.
2. Manage Stock: Track and notify on stock levels.
3. Record Sale: Save sales transactions and adjust stock.
4. Generate Report: Summarize sales for analysis.

Data Stores:
1. Products Table: Stores product details.
2. Suppliers Table: Stores supplier details.
3. Sales Table: Stores sales data.

Data Flows:
- Admin inputs product/supplier details to the database.
- Stock levels are updated and monitored automatically.
- Sales data feeds into reports.

 7. Database Design

 7.1 Database Schema
| Table Name | Columns                                                                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Products       | `Product_ID`, `Name`, `SKU`, `Price`, `Stock_Quantity`, `Supplier_ID`                        |
| Suppliers      | `Supplier_ID`, `Name`, `Contact_Details`                                                    |
| Sales          | `Sale_ID`, `Product_ID`, `Quantity_Sold`, `Sale_Date`, `Customer_ID` (optional)             |
| Inventory_Log  | `Log_ID`, `Product_ID`, `Operation` (Add/Delete/Update), `Quantity`, `Timestamp`            |

 ER Diagram
Design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to illustrate table relationships:
- Products ↔ Suppliers: One-to-Many
- Products ↔ Sales: One-to-Many

 8. Mockup
Here’s a high-level UI flow for the system:
1. Login Page: User authentication.
2. Dashboard:
   - Admin: Access to Product, Stock, and Supplier Management.
   - Sales Staff: Access to Sales Processing and Reporting.
3. Product Management Page: Add, update, and delete product details.
4. Stock Alerts: Notifications for low stock levels.
5. Reports Page: Generate and view sales reports.

(Mockup Tool Suggestion: Use Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to create visual layouts.)



 Summary
This structured design outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for an Inventory Management System. 
The provided diagrams (Architecture, DFD, and ER) and the phased project flow should guide its development effectively. 
By implementing this, your small retail business will have a robust system for inventory control and sales management.
